     * Main routine of a worker in the distributed collections library global load
     * balancer
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * In this load balancer, a worker is not bound to any single task. Instead, it
     * takes work from any available operation and continues running until it
     * completely runs out of work. Workers are spawned with an initial assignment.
     * The main steps of this procedure are:
     * &lt;ol&gt;
     * &lt;li&gt;Process a part of the work fragment the worker has, as defined by
     * {@link #granularity}
     * &lt;li&gt;Attempt to spawn a new parallel worker from the work presumably available
     * in the {@link #reserve}
     *
     * &lt;li&gt;Check for any load balancing operation is needed
     * &lt;li&gt;If other asynchronous activities are waiting, yield its execution to
     * allow them to execute NOT IMPLEMENTED YET
     * &lt;/ol&gt;
     * These steps are repeated in a loop until the Assignment held by the worker is
     * completed. When the worker exits that loop, it attempts to get a new
     * Assignment from the {@link #reserve}. If successful, repeat the procedure
     * from step 1. If unsuccessful, the worker stops.
     *
     * @param id {@link Integer} used to identify workers. The type of this
     *           parameter may be changed later to be able to attach some runtime
     *           facilities to the worker specific to some operations. For example
     *           when dealing with operation which consist in placing the results
     *           into {@link Bag}, we may want to initialize a single unique List
     *           for each worker with this list being re-used for multiple
     *           Assignments on this operation.
